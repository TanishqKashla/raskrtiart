# 6. How to Add a New Store Product

Products appear in the **Buy Artworks section** and also have their own product pages.

## Step 1 — Add Product Images

Create a new folder inside:

```
public/store/
```

Example:

```
public/store/my-product/
```

Add images like:

```
1.jpg
2.jpg
3.jpg
```

## Step 2 — Edit Store Data File

Open:

```
app/data/storeData.js
```

Add a new product entry.

### Example Product Entry

```
category: general
title: My New Artwork
slug: my-new-artwork
artist: Shweta Singh
price: 2500
timeToMake: 1 week
medium: acrylic
base: canvas board
dimensions: 12 x 12 inches
inStock: true
```

Images will be referenced from the folder created earlier.

⚠️ Important:

Each product must have a **unique slug** because it is used in the product page URL.

Example:

```
/shop/my-new-artwork
```
